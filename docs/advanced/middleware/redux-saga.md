# redux-saga

Using Redux Subspace with [`redux-saga`](https://redux-saga.js.org/) is pretty similar to using it with Redux itself, except rather than subspacing the store, you need to subspace the sagas. The [`redux-subspace-saga` package](/packages/redux-subspace-saga) provides many useful functions to facilite this.

For more details, refer to the [`redux-subspace-saga` documentation](/packages/redux-subspace-saga/docs).
