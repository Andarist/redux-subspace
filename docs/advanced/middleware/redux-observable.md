# redux-observable

Using Redux Subspace with [`redux-observable`](https://redux-observable.js.org/) is pretty similar to using it with Redux itself, except rather than subspacing the store, you need to subspace the epics. The [`redux-subspace-observable` package](/packages/redux-subspace-observable/README.md) provides many useful functions to facilite this.

For more details, refer to the [`redux-subspace-observable` documentation](/packages/redux-subspace-observable/docs/README.md).
