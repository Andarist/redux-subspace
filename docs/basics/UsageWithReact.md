# Usage With React

Whilst Redux Subspace will work with any application using Redux, it was originally built to create isolated and reusable Redux connected React components.  In fact, version 1 or Redux Subspace only provided React bindings to create subspaces and nothing else.

Since version 2, Redux Subspace has been split into multiple packages to cater for different types of Redux applications.  The React bindings have been moved into the [`react-redux-subspace` package](/packages/react-redux-subspace). Please see the [migration guide](/docs/Migrating.md) if you are upgrading from version 1 to version 2.

For more details, refer to the [`react-redux-subspace` documentation](/packages/react-redux-subspace/docs).
