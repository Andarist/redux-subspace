# Cancellable Counter Example

This example extends [Redux Saga's cancellable counter example](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/tree/master/examples/cancellable-counter) to have multiple counters on the same page.

To run the example locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ioof-holdings/redux-subspace.git

cd redux-subspace/packages/redux-subspace-saga/examples/cancellable-counter
npm install
npm start
```

Or check out the [sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/ioof-holdings/redux-subspace/tree/master/packages/redux-subspace-saga/examples/cancellable-counter).
