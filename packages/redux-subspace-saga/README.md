# redux-subspace-saga

This is a library to create subspaces for sagas. It's designed to work with [redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org) middleware.

## What it does

TODO: this

### Use this library if:

* You are using a single global Redux store, but would like to create decoupled sagas.
* You want actions dispatched from these components to not be picked up by reducers in other components (i.e. avoid action cross talk).
